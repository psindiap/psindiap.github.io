Hey there! I am currently a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2024, where I developed a solid foundation in AI, software development, and system optimization. I am passionate about solving challenging problems through innovating new ideas, designing implementations and testing out the utility of the latest arts as they come.

My interests in artificial intelligence, and development in general, have led me to pursue various research and industry experiences. I have interned at leading companies such as Uber, Sprinklr, and Jio Platforms, where I helped develop and optimize software systems, and enhanced system performance. During my research internships at BITS Pilani and Mercedes-Benz, I focused on developing AI-driven solutions for healthcare and automotive design, respectively.

Besides Academics, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction, watching Sitcoms and thriller (preferably infused with horror) films, along with checking out the latest trends in general on X (who knows what's going to take the world by storm next!). I also keep up with the latest updates on Cricket, Chess and WWE, to keep me entertained from time-to-time.
